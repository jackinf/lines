## Rules

Here are the detailed rules with specific numbers for the game "Lines" or "Color Lines":

### Game Board
The game is played on a 9x9 grid.

### Objective
Arrange five or more balls of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal to clear them and score points.

### Starting the Game
Initially, 5 balls of random colors are placed on the board.

### Moving Balls

You can move one ball per turn.
To move a ball, click on it and then click on an empty cell. The ball will move to the empty cell if there is a clear path (i.e., if the cells between the start and end points are empty).
Generating New Balls:

After each move, 3 new balls appear on the board at random positions.
The colors and positions of these new balls are often shown in advance, giving you a chance to strategize.
Clearing Balls:

If you successfully line up five or more balls of the same color, they disappear from the board, and you score points.
If balls are cleared during your move, no new balls will appear for that turn.
Scoring:

- 5 balls in a line: 10 points
- 6 balls in a line: 12 points
- 7 balls in a line: 14 points
- 8 balls in a line: 16 points
- 9 balls in a line: 18 points
- For each additional ball beyond 5 in a single line, you typically get 2 extra points.

### Game Over

The game ends when the board is completely filled with balls, and there are no more empty cells available for new balls to appear.

### Strategy

The key strategy is to plan your moves to create lines of five or more balls while managing the new balls that appear each turn. Blocking key areas with balls of different colors can complicate your progress, so careful planning is essential.

Enjoy playing the game!
